#List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python using a single line of code.
# It is often more readable and faster than using loops.

# squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
# print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]


# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# new_numbers = [n + 2 for n in numbers]
# print(new_numbers) #OutPut: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# #another example
# name = "Ejaz Ahmad"
# new_list = [letter for letter in name]
# print(new_list) #output: ['E', 'j', 'a', 'z', ' ', 'A', 'h', 'm', 'a', 'd']

#
# range_list = [num * 2 for num in range(10)]
# print(range_list) #OutPut: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
